BLM-Basic-Starter-WordPress-Theme-No-Blog
=========================================

Basic WordPress starter themes for creating websites with static pages only.

This is theme is a continuation of my work with the original BLM Basic starter themes. 
(https://github.com/crondeau/BLM-Basic-Starter-WordPress-Theme-HTML5)

I use this theme for building all my sites, but on average, most sites don't have a blog component. 
So the initial process involves removing comment, the archives, search etc.. so instead of doing that over and over again, why not just do it once and for all.

This theme only has what you need for a static site. 

--------------------------------------------------------

THIS THEME IS TO BE USED FOR BUILDING CUSTOM THEMES ONLY.

Just like the original version, this theme is devoid of design elements and so won't look that great out of the box.
It's also missing some recommended features which would be needed if you wanted to release a theme in the WordPress repository.

If you want to create a simple custom theme, this might be the theme for you.
So check it out.

You can check out a demo of the theme here.
